# word2vec-music-recommender

Build a song recommender using the word2vec algorithm on LastFM music streaming user data. 

• investigated SkipGram and Continuous-Bag-Of-Words pre-processing techniques   
• implement a variation of Bagged-Prod2Vec as each user's chronological "listening-session" (instead of their entire listening history)   
• make one-to-one song recommendations   
• place users into the song embedding space to then make multiple recommendations (User2vec)     
• implement a collaborative filtering matrix using song listen-counts as a pseudo-rating      
• make qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the results
